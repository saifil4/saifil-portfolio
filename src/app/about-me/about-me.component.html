                        Hey, I am Saifil, a developer and designer. I have a background in computer science and
                        have graduated from the Interactive Media Management program. I have experience working with
                       small organizations and assisting them in
                        building accessible and usable products. I love trying out new things and am constantly
                        learning. Apart from my work, I love playing chess and ping pong and hold an interest in
                        sustainable development, especially in the space of architecture.
